        Exception:
        An error that occurs during program execution, which can stop the program if not handled properly.

        try block:
        Contains code that might throw an exception.

        catch block:
        Catches and handles the exception so the program doesnâ€™t crash.

        finally block:
        Always runs, whether an exception occurs or not (used for cleanup operations).

        Checked Exceptions:
        These are checked at compile time (e.g., IOException, InterruptedException).

        Unchecked Exceptions:
        These occur during runtime (e.g., ArithmeticException, NullPointerException).

        Best Practice:
        Always handle possible exceptions to make programs more stable and user-friendly
